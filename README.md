Description: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of car sales data to identify trends, customer preferences, and sales performance across different car models and regions.
Purpose: To support data-driven decision-making for automotive sales strategies by analyzing customer preferences, sales performance, and regional demand variations.
Steps: I imported an Excel file for car sales to the SQL server. I connected the SQL server to a Power BI. I used Power Query to clean and prepare the data. I Used DAX to calculate some insights like Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales, and more. I created a dashboard to show these insights.
